<section>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Lonar ("the Application", "we") collects, uses, and protects the personal data of users ("User") in compliance with Google API Services User Data Policy and applicable privacy laws.</p>
    <p>The Application is a personal assistant designed to help Users manage and automate personal and professional tasks within Google services (such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks).</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>1. Data Collected and Purpose of Use</h2>
    <p>The Application requires access to the following sensitive data (defined as "Sensitive Scopes" by Google) solely to provide the requested functionality:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Google Service</th>
            <th>Data Collected</th>
            <th>Purpose of Use (CRITICAL)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gmail</td>
            <td>Read, send, delete, modify emails</td>
            <td>Only to perform actions requested by the User, e.g., "Send an email to Mario", "Summarize unread emails", "Find flight receipt X".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Drive</td>
            <td>Access, modify, create, delete files</td>
            <td>Only to retrieve or create documents on User request, e.g., "Find March report" or "Create a new note in Drive".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Calendar</td>
            <td>Access, create, modify events</td>
            <td>Only to manage the calendar, e.g., "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 10:00" or "Check my appointments".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Tasks & Contacts</td>
            <td>Manage tasks and search contacts</td>
            <td>Only to add reminders or find necessary information to perform actions, e.g., sending emails.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The Application only performs actions explicitly requested by the User and does not access data for any purposes other than those described.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. Prohibition of Unauthorized Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NO THIRD-PARTY SHARING:</strong> User sensitive data (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts) will never be shared, sold, or rented to third parties for marketing, advertising, or unrelated purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>NO ADVERTISING:</strong> The Application does not display ads and does not use personal data for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>NO USE BEYOND FUNCTIONALITY:</strong> Data is used only to process User commands and provide expected responses.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>All data exchanged between the Application and Google servers is handled via encrypted connections (HTTPS). The Application does not store full email contents or Drive files on its servers. Session data necessary for operation (such as access tokens) is protected and revocable at any time.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users have the right to revoke access to the Application at any time via their Google account security settings. Revocation will immediately terminate all services provided by the Application.</p>
